# Active directory Home Lab

## Objective

The Active Directory Home Lab project aimed to build a environment for learning how domain environments work. The primary focus was to explore how to ingest events to a SIEM and generate telemetry related to real world attacks. This lab provided hands-on experience in managing domain infrastructure, detecting privilege escalation techniques, and reinforcing foundational skills in Windows network security
